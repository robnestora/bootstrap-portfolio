<h1>About Me

<p><img class="img-fluid" id="rob" src="assets/images/rob.jpg">My name is Rob Nestora and I am an Associate Editor for Autotrader.  Basically my job consists of wrestling with a finicky content management system, driving cars, and writing articles about them.  It's a pretty badass gig and sometimes I wonder how I even got this job in the first place.  But life's funny like that - you never know where you're gonna end up.  You just have to keep plugging away and making things happen. </p>

<p>I've definitely walked the path least traveled throughout my life while working a variety of awful jobs just to keep the lights on. I've been a doorguy, a barback, and a bartender so I've broken up fights, cleaned up the blood and served the survivors cocktails. For a while, I was even a rapper, but that's a story for another website.  Anyway, after years of mischief and debauchery, I finally decided to get my life together and finish my Bachelors Degree in Information Systems at Kennesaw State University.  In 2016, I graduated Magna Cum Laude, surprising pretty much every guidance counselor I ever had, as well as myself. </p>

<p>So for the last two years I've been driving cars and traveling to new places to drive them.  Perhaps out of fear, or maybe out of my need to push myself, I decided to join this course in order to learn full stack development, so that no matter what I can keep doing cool stuff and live an awesome life.  After all that's what it's all about!</p>
